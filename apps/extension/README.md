# Install

[Install extension from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/locatorjs/npbfdllefekhdplbkdigpncggmojpefi)

# Troubleshooting

If LocatorJS is not working, please check the following:

- If you are using **framework/boilerplate like Next.js, Vite or Create React App**, make sure you are running it in development mode. (like `npm run dev`)
- If you have **custom webpack config or anything using Babel** make sure you have [babel-preset-react](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) preset or [babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx-source](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx-source) plugin.
- If you are using **SWC** make sure you are running it in development mode.
